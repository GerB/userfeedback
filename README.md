# User Feedback extension

This phpBB extension enables registered users to insert feedback about other users (similar to eBay feedback system or iTrader for vBulletin). This extension was developed by [Riccardo Bianconi](http://www.riccardobianconi.it/en/phpbb-extension-user-feedback/) for phpBB 3.1. This is an updated version for phpBB 3.2 that is also compatible with MySQL 5.5.5. 

At this point I don't give active support to this extension since I do not use this myself and have only fixed some reported issues. Perhaps this helps you, if not provide me some coffee and I'll try to take a look for you. :)

## Installation

* Copy the contents of the extension to phpBB/ext/riccardobianconi/userfeedback
* Go to "ACP" > "Customise" > "Extensions" and enable the "User Feedback for phpBB" extension.
* Go to the Extensions tab and find the "User Feedback" settings. Setup as explained there.

# Support development
I'm doing this in my spare time and I'm fueled by coffee. Buy me one through [paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=2YBSSF68LXBAN) :)
